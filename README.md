## User Story/Persona
Paul is an avid F1 fan, he subscribes to F1 TV to watch the races and uses the F1 website to keep up with the news and races.  However, none of Paulâ€™s close friends or family really care for F1 and he is looking for somewhere he can go to exclusively talk about the sport.  Paul wants to be able to go to the site and select his current favorite driver, team, and track so that other users can see who or what his favorites are in those categories.  Paul would like a message board where people can share messages and reply to keep conversations going.  Paul would also like to have the ability to comment on his favorite track so he can share what he enjoys about it.  </br>

##User Experience
1. User opens landing page and clicks button for animation and redirect
2. User can view message board, but all other site functionality is behind google oauth
3. User can click login with google or when attempting to access any other site features will be directed to the google login.  Once logged in the user will be redirected back to the messages page.
4.

## Project status
Currently best played at fullscreen on a 1080p resolution, While the project is complete in its initial form I would like to revisit the following:<br/>
Build in media query functionality to clean up the visuals for mobile or smaller resolutions<br/>
Add in 2 player functionality and make appropriate changes to game such as adding the ship sunk indicator. <br/>
